# Test GCP Vision AI

[This is just some code from the Vision AI docs to test out the library with C#.](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/libraries)

To run this project, you must have a GCP service account key set as the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable in your command line.

This was supposed to be then transfered over to a Unity project for use with AR
Foundation, but Unity doesn't have support for NuGet and the alternatives ways
to import the library were not working, so this implementation of machine vision
has been scrapped.
